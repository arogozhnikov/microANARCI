# microANARCI

Minified version of [ANARCI](https://github.com/oxpig/ANARCI). Pip-installable.

- mimics currently latest version of ANARCI (main branch in the repo, as of Feb 2025)
- installation just pulls hmmer weights that were copied from bioconda instead of rebuilding those
- dropped deprecated packaging methods


## Installation:

1. install hmmer (`apt install hmmer` or `brew install hmmer`)
2. `pip install git+https://github.com/arogozhnikov/microANARCI`
